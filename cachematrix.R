## This file contains two functions. A short description on their functionalities:
## 1) makeCacheMatrix: Create a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse
## 2) cacheSolve: Computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix. If the inverse has already been calculated, the the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache 

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  #Set the value of the matrix
  #Get the value of the vector
  #Set the value of the mean
  #Get the value of the mean
}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  #solve(x)
}
